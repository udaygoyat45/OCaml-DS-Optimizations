### Optimized Data Structures & Algorithms

For honing my own skills and providing to the greater community, I want to write `optimized` 
data structures and algorithms within OCaml. Some DSA are alreay as performant as they can be, 
for instance, lists and arrays. 

This repo contains `optimized` versions of these data structures and algorithms:
* Priority Queue
* self-adjusting BST
*
